# Why do I care about this, and why should you?

- Computers are disappointing, and should be better, and to make them better we
  have to start by dreaming bigger about what they can do for us.

- Writing TeX is really hard with limited working memory and shitty devtools.

- I need notes and documents to be *good* --- not only easy to write and
  well-formatted, but easy to share, interact with, and read.

- I need my tools to help me, and TeX just gets in my way too much.
