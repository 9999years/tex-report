# Beyond TeX: Towards a Better Open-Source Typesetting System

- What do other TeX users think a better system looks like? (C.f. Ogawa)

- What capabilities does TeX lack that we want?

- Things we might want in a plain-text-input language.

  - Limitations of plain-text input.

    - There's only so many keys on the keyboard, so typing a lot of special
      characters is hard without a specifically-developed input extension.

    - Plain text editors --- and even IDEs --- are really limited by a
      monospaced grid of glyphs in the way they can present text and metadata
      to users.

      This prevents the program/compiler from easily providing in-depth
      feedback.

- What a *non*-plain-text-input programming language would (or rather, *does*)
  look like, and what advantages it could have.
