# Why is TeX so hard to replace?

- TeX's flaws are well known --- why hasn't anyone done anything about it?

- TeX's design is poor and feels unfinished; in chapter 14, titled "How TeX
  Breaks Paragraphs into Lines", Knuth notes that one possible item in a
  horizontal list is "a 'whatsit' (something special to be explained later)"
  (p. 95) --- it feels like there are parts Knuth barely bothered to design.
  "He probably knew it was bad and just wanted to finish it and do other
  things", a friend speculates while we chat.

- Talk about expl3 and what it does; hungarian notation, sort of a type system,
  etc., but ultimately hindered by TeX's underlying model.
